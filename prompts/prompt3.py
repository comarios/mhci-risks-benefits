        Assess the AI system's alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

        Follow the streamlined steps below:
        1. Describe the AI System: Craft a concise description of the AI system, ensuring it parallels the phrasing used in the Sustainable Development Goal targets and indicators. Your description should begin with "The AI system is designed to..." and should be encapsulated within two sentences.
        2. Evaluate Each SDG:
            For each of the 3 given SDGs, assess if the AI system aligns with or supports the respective SDG. Reference the exact text from the SDG targets and indicators and provide a thorough rationale.
            Rigorously validate your reasoning. The true intent and capabilities of the AI system are crucial for this evaluation. Ensure there is a direct correlation between the system's functionalities and the referenced indicators.
        3. Reference Targets & Indicators: While evaluating, explicitly cite the SDG targets and indicators that resonate most with the AI system's purpose and capabilities.
        4. Classify Non-relevant SDGs: If the AI system does not align with a particular SDG, label it as "Not Relevant" for that SDG.

        Remember, precision is paramount. It's vital to make informed and accurate determinations regarding the AI system's alignment with each SDG. Ensure all SDG targets and indicators are meticulously considered during your assessment.

        Assess the AI system's alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

        Follow the streamlined steps below:
        1. Describe the AI System: Craft a concise description of the AI system, ensuring it parallels the phrasing used in the Sustainable Development Goal targets and indicators. Your description should begin with "The AI system is designed to..." and should be encapsulated within two sentences.
        2. Evaluate Each SDG:
            For each of the 3 given SDGs, assess if the AI system aligns with or supports the respective SDG. Reference the exact text from the SDG targets and indicators and provide a thorough rationale.
            Rigorously validate your reasoning. The true intent and capabilities of the AI system are crucial for this evaluation. Ensure there is a direct correlation between the system's functionalities and the referenced indicators.
        3. Reference Targets & Indicators: While evaluating, explicitly cite the SDG targets and indicators that resonate most with the AI system's purpose and capabilities.
        4. Classify Non-relevant SDGs: If the AI system does not align with a particular SDG, label it as "Not Relevant" for that SDG.

        Remember, precision is paramount. It's vital to make informed and accurate determinations regarding the AI system's alignment with each SDG. Ensure all SDG targets and indicators are meticulously considered during your assessment.

        Assess the AI system's alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

        Follow the streamlined steps below:
        1. Describe the AI System: Craft a concise description of the AI system, ensuring it parallels the phrasing used in the Sustainable Development Goal targets and indicators. Your description should begin with "The AI system is designed to..." and should be encapsulated within two sentences.
        2. Evaluate Each SDG:
            For each of the 3 given SDGs, assess if the AI system aligns with or supports the respective SDG. Reference the exact text from the SDG targets and indicators and provide a thorough rationale.
            Rigorously validate your reasoning. The true intent and capabilities of the AI system are crucial for this evaluation. Ensure there is a direct correlation between the system's functionalities and the referenced indicators.
        3. Reference Targets & Indicators: While evaluating, explicitly cite the SDG targets and indicators that resonate most with the AI system's purpose and capabilities.
        4. Classify Non-relevant SDGs: If the AI system does not align with a particular SDG, label it as "Not Relevant" for that SDG.

        Remember, precision is paramount. It's vital to make informed and accurate determinations regarding the AI system's alignment with each SDG. Ensure all SDG targets and indicators are meticulously considered during your assessment.

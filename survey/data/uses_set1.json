        "Description": "Enhancing security through facial recognition using high-performance cameras in smartphones",
        "Classification": "High Risk",
        "Reasoning": "The AI system is used for biometric identification, which is listed as a high-risk AI system under Article 6(2) and Annex III of the EU AI Act. However, it does not fall under the category of 'Unacceptable Risk' as it does not violate any of the prohibitions listed under Article 5 of the Act. The amendments 710 and 711 further clarify that biometric and biometrics-based systems are considered high-risk, but the system in question does not fall under the exceptions mentioned in Article 5, thus confirming its classification as 'High Risk'."

        "Use": 2,
        "Description": "Monitoring and analyzing crowd behavior using mobile cameras",
        "Classification": "High Risk",
        "Reasoning": "The AI system is intended to be used by public safety authorities for real-time crowd behavior analysis, which involves biometric identification and categorization of natural persons in public spaces. This aligns with the description of high-risk AI systems under Article 6(2) and Annex III, point 1(a) of the EU AI Act. The amendments 711 further clarify that AI systems used for biometric identification of natural persons are considered high risk, with the exception of those mentioned in Article 5, which does not apply in this case. Therefore, the AI system is classified as High Risk."

        "Classification": "High Risk",
        "Reasoning": "The AI system is intended to be used by law enforcement agencies, which falls under the 'Law Enforcement' category of high-risk AI systems as per the EU AI Act. Furthermore, the system's purpose of identifying individuals through facial recognition and gait analysis falls under the 'Biometric identification and categorisation of natural persons' category. The system does not seem to violate any of the prohibitions outlined in Article 5, hence it is not classified as an 'Unacceptable Risk'. Therefore, considering the purpose, user, and capabilities of the AI system, it is classified as 'High Risk'."

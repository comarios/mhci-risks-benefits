        "Classification":  "High Risk",
        "Reasoning": "The AI system is used in the domain of education and vocational training, which is listed as a high-risk area in the EU AI Act. Although the system does not directly determine access or assess students, it is used for remote learning and collaboration, which could indirectly influence these aspects. Therefore, it is classified as high risk. The amendments do not change this classification as they do not specifically address AI systems used for remote learning and collaboration."

        "Classification": "High Risk",
        "Reasoning": "The AI system is intended to monitor employee productivity, which falls under the domain of 'Employment, workers management and access to self-employment'. According to the EU AI Act, AI systems used for 'monitoring and evaluating performance and behavior of persons in such relationships' are considered high risk. This is further supported by Amendment 720, which includes AI systems used to 'monitor and evaluate performance and behavior of persons in such relationships'. Therefore, the AI system is classified as High Risk."

                            EU AI Act is an upcoming regulatory framework for artificial intelligence in European Union.
                            It analyses AI systems in various applications and classifies them based on the risk they
                            present to users into <b>unacceptable, high risk</b> and <b>low risk uses</b>:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Unacceptable uses</b>: these are AI applications that are deemed incompatible with EU
                            values or
                            are inherently unethical. These uses are prohibited outright due to their potential to cause
                            significant harm or violate fundamental rights and freedoms. Examples of unacceptable uses
                            might include AI systems designed to manipulate individuals' behavior, facilitate
                            discrimination,
                            or infringe upon human dignity. The EU AI Act aims to prevent the development and deployment
                            of
                            such applications within the European Union.

                        <p>
                            <b>High risk uses</b>: these are AI applications that pose significant potential risks to
                            the
                            safety, fundamental rights, or freedoms of individuals. These risks might include threats to
                            health,
                            safety, or fundamental rights such as privacy. Examples of high risk uses might include AI
                            in critical infrastructure, law enforcement, healthcare, or transportation. These
                            applications
                            are subject to stricter regulations and oversight to mitigate potential harms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Low risk uses</b>: these are AI applications that have a lower potential to cause harm to
                            individuals or society. They are considered to pose minimal risks to safety, fundamental
                            rights, or freedoms. Examples of low risk uses might include AI in entertainment, customer
                            service,
                            or basic administrative tasks. While these applications are subject to some regulation, they
                            generally face fewer compliance requirements compared to high risk uses.
